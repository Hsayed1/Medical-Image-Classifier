# Problem Statement
The topic of my project is pertaining to the medical industry and radiology scans done on patients. The problem of classifying radiology image scans using neural networks is very important. Firstly, it offers the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency of medical diagnosis. By automating the categorization of radiology images into their respective type, it streamlines the diagnostic process, allowing radiologists and medical professionals to dedicate more time to complex diagnostic tasks. Additionally, this automation leads to improved patient outcomes through early and accurate identification of imaging modalities, facilitating quicker medical interventions, which is particularly vital for time-sensitive conditions. Furthermore, the problem has broader implications for healthcare resource allocation. Resource optimization is possible as healthcare facilities can efficiently allocate experts and imaging equipment based on the type of scans, enhancing the overall efficiency of healthcare systems. In summary, the successful solution to this problem stands to greatly benefit healthcare by improving diagnostic efficiency, patient outcomes, resource allocation, telemedicine, education, and research in the medical field. The innovative aspect of my project is that I will be testing my CNN with different hyperparameters to discern the most optimal model for image classification. Along with that I plan to use a pre-tuned image classification model to try to come up with a more accurate model. The project's goal is to advance the field of medical imaging and healthcare by leveraging machine learning to address challenges. I hope to achieve a reliable and accurate automated classification system that has real-world applications in healthcare facilities and telemedicine services. By doing so, I aim to improve patient care, optimize resource allocation, and contribute to medical research and training.
